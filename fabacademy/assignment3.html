                                <p>In this section, we have to work on Vinyl cutters, Laser cutters and use them and characterise them.</p>

                                <p><b>Vinyl Cutting</b></p>

                                <img class="float-left" src="assets/img/doc/roland.jpg" />

                              </div>

                                <p>
                               The Vinyl cutter machine is used to create signs or letters, make banners etc.It is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like a desktop printer. Like a printer controls a nozzle, the computer controls the movement of a sharp blade over the surface of the material. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic.
                                </p>

                                <p><b>Setup Roland GS-24:</b></p>

                                <p>So first i have to setup the Roland GS-24 vinyl cutter by installing the required drivers, softwares and then i shall print a test print into it.Visit <a href="https://startup.rolanddg.com/">https://startup.rolanddg.com/</a> and select “CAMM-1” series, then select the printer model as “GS-24”. Also select the mode of connection of machine with the system. In my case it is USB connection as shown below.
                                </p>

                                <img style="width: 30%; height: 30%;"src="assets/img/doc/roland2.png"/>

                                <p>
                                Next, I downloaded the driver by accepting all the terms and conditions and install the driver following the procedures below:

                                 <ul>
                                  <li>Log on to Windows as “Administrators.”</li>
                                  <li>Unzip the downloaded file, and open the folder.</li>
                                  <li>Open the folder for your operating system. (WINX64)</li>
                                  <li>Double-click the file "SETUP64.exe" (64-bit edition) located in the folder.</li>
                                  <li>When "User Account Control" window appears on the screen, click [Continue].</li>
                                  <li>Select [Install], "Model" to install, port [USB], and click [Start].</li>
                                  <li>When driver is installed successfully, turn on the power switch of the machine, and connect the machine to the computer using the USB cable. Then the computer shall install driver for Roland GS24 and after some time it should appear in “Devices & Printers” menu of Computer.</li>
                                  </ul> 
                                </p>

                                <img style="width: 30%; height: 30%;"src="assets/img/doc/roland3.jpg"/>

                                <p><b>Download Roland Onsupport</b></p>
                                <p>
                                
                                After successfully downloading the driver, then i need to download the roland onsupport application where i can the required manuals and also the "Roland Cutstudio" Software which i will use to cut the vinyl. So i downloaded Roland Cutstudio following the steps and created an account to signing in. Then under tab "Edit->Device Management" i have an option to choose the mode of connection. I chose USB while connecting my Machine to the system USB. Then i selected the COM PORT and click on verify to pair the machine with the system.</p>

                                <img style="width: 25%; height: 25%;"src="assets/img/doc/roland3.jpg"/>
                                <p>

                                Then under "Software" Tab there was a option to download "Roland Cutstudio" which i downloaded and installed.Then i designed a Text of my name in Roland Cutstudio as shown below:(I have also defined the Roll size 23 inch which i used in my machine).

                              </p>

                              <img style="width: 50%; height: 50%;"src="assets/img/doc/CUT1.jpeg"/>

                              <p>

                                <p>

                                Now, load the Roll in the machine, and Pull the lever in correct position to lock the Sheet. Then using arrows, i can move the pointer to desired position. Then placed the rollers on the White markers and then set the origin by long pressing the origin button.

                              </p>

                              <img style="width: 50%; height: 50%;"src="assets/img/doc/vinyl5.jpg"/>
                              <img style="width: 40%; height: 40%;"src="assets/img/doc/vinyl4.jpg"/>

                              <p>

                                Then in "Roland Cut studio", Click on cutting, then the preview Tab with all the details came and to start cutting, i had to click on "OK".

                              </p>
                              <img style="width: 50%; height: 50%;"src="assets/img/doc/cut2.png"/>
                            </div>

                            <p>

                                After cutting, I used transfer Tape to remove the texts and pasted it on my Table.

                              </p>

                                <p><b>Laser Cutting:</b></p>

                                <p>
                                Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to slice materials. This non-contact, thermal-based fabrication process is ideal for several materials, including wood, glass, paper, metal, plastic etc.Here i have used a "Epilog Fusion M2" which is available in our Lab to fabricate few designs.
                                </p>

                                  <p>
                                
                                For characterisation of the Laser cutter, i have designed a file with multiple dimensions for both MDF and Acrylic board using FreeCAD.The freeCAD designed files are shown as below:
                                </p>

                                After cutting the above designed files with Acrylic and MDF boards the pieces are as shown below. We found a kerf of 0.1 mm both sides which is measured as below.

                                We followed the same procedure for the acrylic dimension board also and found the results as shown below:

                                 <p><b>Create the Press fit construction kit:</b>

                                <p>
                                
                                Press fit constructions are a method where two materials are joined together by means of friction after pushing both bodies rather than any fastening procedures. I have designed some press fit designs in Inkspace first as shown below. I have used veneer boards for printing of the press fits.

                                During design in inkspace, i got to know that for vector cuttings, we need to set the fill as "No fill" and put stroke in red color and width in "0.01 mm" then it exported it to a pdf file which can be given to epilog job manager with setting following parameters.
                                </p>

                                <p>
