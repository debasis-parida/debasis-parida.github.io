                                  This week's assignment is on CNC router, which is basically based on milling and assembling some structures using materials like wood based on a 2D design.We also had to test different parameters of our Shopbot CNC router such as Kerf, Speed etc.</p>

                                  CNC routers are machines used to cut many types of materials, such as wood, plastic, aluminum, and high-density foam. CNC stands for computer numerical control, which indicates computer software and electronics controlled machines instead of a direct human operator.

                                  CNC machines can cut along three directions known as the X, Y, and Z axes. The X-axis is the front to back direction, which is usually the longest. The Y-axis is the left and right direction and the Z-axis is the up and down direction.

                                <div class="large-12 columns">

                                	<img style="width: 60%; height: 60%;"class="float-left" src="assets/img/doc/week7/2.jpg" />
                                </div>

                                <div class="large-12 columns">

                                  	<p><b>Spindle:</b> This is responsible for the cutting.The spindle cuts by rotating its cutting bit at different speeds depending on the material. Softer materials generally require higher revolutions per minute (rpm), while it will cut harder materials at slower speeds.</p>

                                  	<p><b>Cutting Bed:</b>The cutting bed is the flat surface on which the CNC works. It is where we will place the materials that they need to cut and we can then fix material to the cutting bed by using screws,clamps and bolt to ensure the material will not move.</p>

                                  	<p><b>Drive Systems:</b>Drive systems allow the router to move along each of the three axes, and therefore, there is one for each direction. A single drive system consists of a motor, a bearing or guiding system along which the router moves, and a means of moving. Typically, it can move due to a mechanism consisting of a ball or lead screw system or a rack and pinion setup.</p>

                                  	<p><b>Difference between Drill bits and End mills:</b>Basically drill bit moves only up and down which is used to make a hole in a material, but an end mill moves side-to-side to remove unwanted material from a surface to give a useful object.Endmills are available in a wide variety of lengths, diameters, flutes and types, and are chosen according to the material they are cutting and the surface finish required for the project</p>

                                  	<b>Types of End mills:</b>

                                  	<b>Straight Flute End mills:</b>

                                  	<p>End mills have cutting surfaces are called flutes. The most common end mills have two to four flutes. Generally, fewer flutes evacuate more chips from your material, keeping the bit cool. However, more flutes produce a finer edge finish. There are four basic flute types, each optimized for different materials and edge finish. Solid carbide or carbide tipped are ideal since they don’t dull as easily as HSS (high speed steel) end mills.</p>

                                  	<b>Upcut and Downcut End Mills:</b>

                                  	<p>These spiral, flute-shaped end mills either carry chips up and away from the material or down into them. An upcut will keep the bit cool while quickly evacuating materials when cutting plastic or aluminum, however, it will fray the top surface, and may lift your material so be sure to have adequate hold-downs in place.</p>

                                  	<b>V-bit End Mills:</b>

                                  	<p>A 60° or 90° V-bit is great for what’s called V-carving, in which the tip of a V-shaped bit is used to cut into narrow spaces, and the wide bottom is used to cut into larger spaces. V-bits can also create sharp corners that other end mills cannot because of their radiuses.</p>

                                  	<b>Ballnose End Mill:</b>

                                  	<p>These bits have a rounded tip and are ideal for 3D tool paths. When combined with a “roughing” bit to clear large areas of material, this end mill will result in smooth 3D surfaces, especially with two or more passes.</p>

                              <b>Operating Procedures:</b>

                                <p>
                              For operating shopbot, first thing is to ensure that we have taken all the safety measures like Wearing safety glasses, gloves and headphones to prevent unwanted accidents.

                              Then, let's cut a simple design to test the functionality of the router. I have made a simple circle using "Vcarve Pro" software, which is the official software of Shopbot for creating and cutting parts on a CNC Router. VCarve Pro gives the tools to create complex 2D patterns with profile, pocket, drill and inlay toolpaths.

                              <p>
                               After completing the design in "Vcarve Pro" i need to add neccessary tools like profile toolpath or drill toolpaths as necessary.Then i saved it as .sbp extension file which is required for Shopbot to complete the task.

                                <p>
                                  First, we tried to test some basic characteristics of CNC router like Kerf, Fitting test etc. So, first we took a simple rectangle to test the fitting and what we did is, we cut the inner part of the rectangle as "Outcut" separately and then again for the slot, we cut the design in "incut", so that the rectangle will fit into the slot perfectly. After cutting them separately we fitted them as shown below and it fits perfectly as expected.
                                  <img style="width: 60%; height: 60%;"class="float-left" src="assets/img/doc/week7/28.jpeg" />

                                <p>
                                  After the fitting test, we followed the procedure which we followed in Laser cutting to determine the kerf. We designed a tool with multiple slots considering many tolerance options near to the width of material available with us and then cut it using "oncut". Then we found the kerf as shown below:

                                  as shown in the image the material width is 11.54 mm and the slot where the material is best fitted is 8.25 mm. Hence we found in "Oncut", the kerf is found to be 3.2 mm.That means the end mill is milling out 1.6 mm from both the sides.
                                  </p>

                                  First, i throught of making a Wooden tool box which is very much required for our Fablab to place miscellenous components.So i started designing it using Fusion360 as shown in the images below:

                                  Here one thing to note that, i have changes the material type in Appearance menu under "Preference". So, the material here looks like a plywood.Then i made the side sketches also in the simillar fashion and mirriored it on the other side.

                                  Here i have used the parametric modelling in Fusion360. hence, i can change the design parameters using a simple sheet as shown below:

                                 The box design after placing all the faces looks like below:

                                <p>
                                 Now time to place two slots in the two sides of the box in order to carry the box. For this i used the slot feature of Fusion 360 and mirriored it after extruding the slot.Finally the model looks like below:
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                 Finally, i had to export the model to a .dxf file, which is basically a 2d sketch file, which can be opened with Vcarve pro software to generate the machine code file for CNC cutting.To export, first of all i layed all the bodies of design in a single plane and then projected them into a single sketch. Then i exported the sketch into a dxf file.

                                 Then, i imported the .dxf file in Vcarve pro in which i had to set the material dimensions and cut dimensions including the tool parameters.For My design i chose profile toolpath to cut the outer boundary and the preview can also be seen as shown below:

                                 Finally, i saved the .sbp file from the v carve pro software which i imported in Shopbot software and given to cut after choosing proper X,Y & Z axis of the machine.

                                 After successful cut, i had to remove all the tabs and finish it manually using sand papers.Then i assembled the parts using Screws and after doing the fittings, the final model looks great as shown below.
